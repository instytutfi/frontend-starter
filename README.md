# Frontend Starter

This is a frontend starter repo, which helps you kickstart your next React SPA.
It is highly opinionated, and consists of:

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [Vitest](https://vitest.dev)
* [Cypress](https://cypress.io/)

* [Plop](https://plopjs.com/)
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)
* [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
* [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
* [React i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) et al.
* [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The idea is to be able to start doing stuff in no time, as long as you're fine with the selected stack
and some DX choices made here and there.
